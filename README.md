**Black Board AI** is an engineering work-surface empowered with neural-network handwritten-digit classification.

## Functionality
Currently, the site allows you to draw non-vertically-stacked numbers on the canvas, select any number with a bandbox, and use a tensorflow neural network to try to interpret your written digits, by pressing the "Predict" button.

## Todo
- Optimize canvas rendering
- Recognize mathematical operators
- Compute the results of prediction results
